I have put some initials in front of each category.
First, I want to thank you for the opportunity to work on this amazing project during my internship. I learned a lot about deep learning, and I hope this code can make a meaningful contribution to your future projects. 
I'll be discussing the codes in a specific folder. I couldn't put them into a folder on GitHub, so I added some initials at the beginning of the file names, and I'll explain this so you can understand if it's the folder I mean. All the folders are in the 'Research 9' directory, and the codes are there. I will explain the method behind the code so you can find and edit it later if needed. In the 'Training Code' folder, which has initials 'FK' in front of the code names for 'No Post Process,' 'Test Mask,' 'Test 3,' and 'Train 3,' I recommend understanding these codes first, as they led to the results of a 70% Dice score. The 'non-postprocess' code shows what happens if we do not use post-processing like U-net or CNN. Then, 'train 3' uses those non-post-processed codes but also applies a U-net after the flow of FrangiNet is finished, which improves the results. After each training, some epochs are saved as a PTH file—one named 'epoch 90.pth,' which I uploaded to the drive—so it's important to include them in the code and run tests with your other results. I also included the test mask for when our liver mask, created by AWJ, reaches a good point; you can run it to restrict segmentation to just the liver. 
In the first code folder, I have organized the code to show the outcome of using the U-Net. In the first part, decoding occurs, which allows the unit itself to influence the actual prediction. In the first test code, the initial "1" indicates the first code. The unit will appear first in the main code, leading to two overlaps with the vesselness image and the CT scan. The vesselness code detects the final image and saves it, allowing you to understand its approach. Next, combine all the vesselness, CT, and label files, then run the test code. It will save a PNG file showing how one portion of the final output looks, along with the prediction segmentations. Make sure to run the database code first to ensure all your files are present and you have all three subfiles for each case number in your dataset.
The last codes are those with the final code as their initial, and they are also in my final code folder. They are like the codes in the training folder I mentioned earlier. The only code that is not particularly challenging to write is the plotter, which is useful for copying the epochs and the dice score you get, as well as the validation lies. Then, it provides the file text to this code, enabling it to plot some graphs, as I mentioned in my poster. There is an example of the results of my graph there.
Once again, I want to thank you for letting me contribute to this meaningful project, and I hope my findings will be of real help to you.
Regards.
